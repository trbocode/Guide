If you downgrade to 2.1.0 on a 2DS or New 3DS and left Wireless Communication off, you can re-enable the wireless by removing the battery for several seconds then booting back up.
{: .notice--info}

If you've been using the New 3DS's microSD Management to transfer files to your SD card, this will no longer work on 2.1.0, make sure to have a microSD card reader on hand before proceeding.
{: .notice--info}

Your device may not show your installed games after the ctrtransfer. This is due to the tickets being removed by the transfer, which is why you back them up. They will be restored at the end of the guide.
{: .notice--info}

**For now, connecting your device to the internet is REQUIRED to continue after the 2.1.0 ctrtransfer.**
{: .notice--warning}

**Disable the parental controls of your device before doing the 2.1.0 ctrtransfer. If you do not know the password, see [this](https://mkey.salthax.org/) site.**
{: .notice--warning}

**Performing a ctrtransfer will remove all user-installed tickets from the device until a backup is restored. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you skip creating the backup, or you will LOSE access to all installed games and saves!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Never format a 2DS while on a version <6.0.0 or you will be unable to complete initial setup and will BRICK!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Never update a New 3DS running 2.1.0 (an Old 3DS firmware) or you will BRICK! You MUST restore a NAND backup or ctrtransfer back to standard New 3DS firmware first!**

#### Overview of steps

In this section, we will be flashing your console's [CTRNAND](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Flash_Filesystem#CTR_partition) partition to 2.1.0 in order to take advantage of an oversight in 2.1.0 for the purpose of extracting the [OTP](otp-info) unique to your console. This OTP file is required to install arm9loaderhax, and **cannot** be shared with other consoles.

This is accomplished by [installing a premade ctrtransfer image](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4zhe4a/) containing 2.1.0, copying your console specific files (such as `moveable.sed` and `SecureInfo_A`) to it, then fixing the title databases.

The OTP is a requirement to use arm9loaderhax.

#### What you need

* You will need to have booted into Decrypt9
* The 2.1.0 ctrtransfer image for your device and region     
*(if your device is not from one of these regions, just pick one)*:

**Putting a New 3DS on 2.1.0 in sleep mode is known to cause an UNRECOVERABLE brick!**
**This only happens when shutting the lid _while the device is on_; this does not apply to turning the device off.**
**The device only enters sleep mode when the lid is closed. It is not on a timer or anything like that.**
**You should continue without delay to avoid any possibility of this happening!**
